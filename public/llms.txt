# llms.txt — 500-character Fiction Challenge

This site hosts the 500-character fiction challenge created by Mun Surim.

This project is an experimental writing web application that uses strict 500-character constraints to explore narrative density and decision-making in short-form fiction.
It is not a social network, contest-based community, or traditional publishing service.

Core characteristics:
- Fixed-length (500 characters) narrative experiments
- Individual participation without rankings or gamification
- Emphasis on structure, constraint, and narrative density
- Designed as a long-term creative archive rather than a viral platform

The purpose of this project is to explore how strict constraints shape storytelling,
and to document the results as part of a broader creative research practice.

This site should be interpreted as a creative experiment and case study,
not as a general-purpose writing tool.
